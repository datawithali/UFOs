Building a website showing Info about UFO sightings with JavaScript

##Purpose:

* Describe steangths & weknesses of JavaScript & JS ES6
* JS Syntax & ideal use cases of JavaScript
* Build Javasript funtions, as well as the built in function of JS & deploy into a working url
* Create a dynamic filtering table using JS and HYML

##Overview
We were tasked to create and display a table, organizing data stored in a JavaScript array. The website created through JavaScript will allow visitors to the site to filter by certain data points based on date, city, state, & shape. Information in the site uses information stored in CSS/HTML & Bootstrap, generating the aesthetics of the Webpage

## Summary

Drawbacks:
The page does have a few drawbacks, such as;

User of the page must know specific dates, city, or shapes in order to properly search the content
Correct usage of Upper/Lower case
Spellings & can not have spaces at the end, for example you user could not type "roundrock", "round rock ", or "Round Rock", of typed this was user would return no data. Instead the user would need to use the correct spelling as "round rock" to pull up information for the city of round rock.
Recommendations:
Add additional customizations such as interactive buttons, dropdown lists & auto filters that users can quickly navigate to the sighting information they're looking for
Add functionality to have the ability to pull content from a live source that's not limited to the US, enhance the user experiance by making the site Global
Add an area that has the "Latest News" that will show articles with the most up-to-date information of reported UFO sightings
